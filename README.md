# ryza-items

I'm developing a tool to ease working with the items and recipes found in the game [Atelier Ryza](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1121560/Atelier_Ryza_Ever_Darkness__the_Secret_Hideout/).

This document will be updated as work is completed.

2020-01-29: A rough console application to parse and validate the YAML files for storing items is implemented. This will help keep item data clean, as well as identify items still needed (via Recipe Morph material loops).
